You are going to need a relativly recent version of NodeJS or IO.js, and a new Node project.
Start by creating a project directory and running npm init inside.

```bash
$ mkdir myNewSite && cd myNewSite && npm init
```

Then you'll need to install Pomegranate, along with anything else you may need.
Remember that flexibility we were talking about? Pomegranate comes with SQL, CouchDB, and Redis support
built it, but its simple to add anything you want and use it just like it was built in to the framework.
