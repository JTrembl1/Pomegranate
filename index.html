<h4>Pomegranate might just be the most flexible framework in the universe.</h4>

     alt="Its really flexible, and the universe is very large, so who knows.">
<p>Ok, you got us, Pomegranate may not be the most flexible in the <i>entire</i> universe.
  But it is pretty flexible and we are going to keep it that way without sacrificing the simplicity
  that makes it so easy to use. With an intuitive structure, and a very low noise installation, you can have a project
  up and running in just a
  few lines of code. <a href="https://github.com/PaperElectron/Pomegranate">You can check it out on Github here.</a>

<h1> Why Pomegranate, exactly? </h1>

<p>
  Pomegranate is a backend web framework, designed to produce APIs and entire sites that are easy to reason about,
  easy to maintain, and easy to host. It doesn't dictate how your front end should be written and it doesn't dictate
  how and where data should be stored. Its powerful Dependency Injection framework allows you to design models and
  controllers that integrate seamlessly into the rest of the framework.

<h1>Key Features</h1>


<div class="feature-container">
  <h3 class="feature-header">
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/docs/file-loading">Intuitive structure</a>
  </h3>
  <span>
    Routes, models and controllers are recursively loaded for you,
    just drop your files into the correct directory (or configure it to use your own).
    Route files are saved to the path they will be found via url, so files are easy to find.
  </span>
</div>

<div class="feature-container">
  <h3 class="feature-header">
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/docs/dependency-management">Dependency Injection</a>
  </h3>
  <span>
    Inversion of control makes it simple to gain access to your controllers, models and custom dependencies.
    Inside controllers and route functions, your dependencies are simply a parameter away. Nothing to require
    or pass around, Pomegranate provides you with what you need, where you need it.
  </span>
</div>

<div class="feature-container">
  <h3 class="feature-header">
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/docs/models">Sweet Data modeling</a>
  </h3>
  <span>
    Out of the box support for most SQL servers, using Sequelize as the ORM.
    CouchDb support through Nano. Redis via, well Redis.
    Don't like any of those? Install and register your own with the injector and they will be available
    to you in your controllers and routes... Like Magic!
  </span>
</div>

<div class="feature-container">
  <h3 class="feature-header">
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/docs/controllers">Merged controllers</a>
  </h3>
  <span>
    Controllers are also managed with dependency injection, so it is trivial to include multiple data
    sources in your controllers. Outside libraries you add are available to your controllers in
    exactly the same way as the ones included in Pomegranate.
  </span>
</div>

<div class="feature-container">
  <h3 class="feature-header">
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/docs/middleware">Ultra Flexible Middleware</a>
  </h3>
  <span>
    Take 100% control of your middleware stack, use our defaults, or simple add
    the ones you need. Pomegranate makes it simple.
  </span>
</div>

<div class="feature-container">
  <h3 class="feature-header">
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/docs/logging">Event Based Logging</a>
  </h3>
  <span>
    Attach handlers to the main Pomegranate object to listen to events related to
    Platform logs, Request logs, and Errors, with metadata. You choose where they go.
