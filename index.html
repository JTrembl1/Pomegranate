<h3>Ok, the known universe is a really big place.</h3>
<p>You got us, Pomegranate may not be the most flexible in the <i>entire</i> universe.
    But it is pretty flexible.
    It is rediculously easy to use, while at the same time giving you the power to build whatever you need.
    With an intuitive structure, and a very low noise installation, you can have a project up and running in just a
    few lines of code. <a href="https://github.com/PaperElectron/Pomegranate">You can check it out on Github here.</a>
