We are really glad you are looking at this page and we apologize that its not quite up to snuff.
If you check back here soon, Im sure we'll have some more documentation for you to read.

In the mean time you can check out the docs for [Magnum Di](https://github.com/PaperElectron/Magnum-DI)
which is the Dependency Injection framework Pomegranate uses.

```javascript
!function(words){
